    "\n",
    "Consider the constitution of the United States:\n",
    "\n",
    "> https://www.usconstitution.net/const.txt .\n",

    "**One letter prediction:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Find the set of all characters used in the document. Call the number of characters $n$. \n",
    "2. Create an $n \\times n$ matrix whose $i,j$ entry is the probability that the next character is $j$ given that the current character is $i$. Estimate this probability by looking at all occurrences of character $i$ in the document and the number of times character $j$ immediately follows it. \n",
    "3. Simulate this system as a Markov chain that starts with an arbitrary capital letter and continues until it gets to a space. Produce $100$ random \"words\" this way. How many of them are actual words? Use a [Scrabble dictionary](https://scrabble.hasbro.com/en-us/tools#dictionary) if you are not certain whether a given sequence is a word. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Two letter prediction:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create an $n \\times n \\times n$ tensor whose $i,j,k$ entry is the probability that the next character is $k$ given that the current character is $j$ and the previous character is $i$. Use the document to empirically find these probabilities. \n",
    "2. Use this model to construct random words. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Sentence prediction:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Do a one word prediction, but use all the unique *words* in the document. Hallucinate sentences. Consider a punctuation mark as a word. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Notes:** Use `open` and `file.read` to read in the file as a string. For the sentence. Use `replace` to add space before punctuation and then `split()` to turn the string into a list. Use a `DiGraph` from the `networkx` library to store the data. Note that you can make weighted edges by adding data to the edges, as in [this document](https://networkx.github.io/documentation/stable/auto_examples/drawing/plot_weighted_graph.html)."

    "For the set of words that I manually checked checked, I found that 22 out of the 100 words that were generated were valid scrabble words. So the one letter prediction technique produces valid words at a rate of about 22%. Another interesting observation is that the valid words have an average length of about 2.8 letters, and the invalid words have an average length of about 6.7 letters. The invalid words are more than twice as long. It's clear to see that some of the invalid words are actually pretty long. It appears that sometimes the randomly generated word was originally on the path to forming one word, but then diverged onto a different path by randomly selecting a different letter, and did so repeatedly resulting in a long jumble of letters that appear to be two or more words jumbled together."

    "The second method for generating random words is similar, but instead of looking at occurrences of one character, this method uses each pair of consecutive characters that occur. Then calculates the probabilities of the next character based on the number of times each character appears after the pair of the current character and the character directly before it. For example, in the text \" Order \" if the current character is \"d\", then the previous character is \"r\", and the next character is \"e\". In this string there is only one occurrence of \"rd\", so there is a probability of 1 that the next character is \"e\". Here is the example of the probabilities for this string. Since there are three characters that factor in to the probabilities I need a 3D array to store the probabilities. Each grid represents a different previous character, each row represents a different current character, and each column represents a different next character. Here are the number of occurrences of each combination of letters. I have added a space before and after the text to be able to gather data for both the first and second to last characters.\n",

    "Again, now that I have found the probabilities each character occurring after each pair of letters, I can generate words in a similar manner to the one letter prediction technique. First I select a capital letter at random over a uniform distribution. And I append a space to the front of the word, because this technique requires the current and the previous characters, in order to be able to generate the second letter. Now that I know this current letter and the previous letter, I randomly select the next letter based on the probabilities of any specific letter following that pair.

Then, append a space to the front, and randomly select the next letter based on the probabilities of each letter following \" O\". Looking at the probability tables above, there is a probability of 1 that the next character will be \"r\". Now the current letter is \"r\", and the previous letter is \"O\". So the process is repeated using the probabilities of each letter following the string, \"Or\". From the tables above, there is a probability of 1 that the next letter is \"d\". Now the current letter is \"d\" and the previous letter is \"r\". Following this same process, the next characters are \"e\", \"r\", and a space, indicating the end of the word. The word that has been produced is \"Order\". This makes sense because the only word in the sample text is \"Order\". A more extensive sample text, like the constitution, will produce more varying results."

    "For the set of words generated from the two letter prediction method that I checked, 27 of the 100 words generated by the two letter prediction turned out to be valid scrabble words, so the the two letter prediction produces valid words at a rate of about 27%, which is 5% more than for the one letter prediction. This makes sense because this method takes in to account the previous two letters, instead of just one, and there will be less variance in the characters that follow a specific pair of characters rather than just one.\n",

    "It's also interesting to note that the average length of the words using the two letter prediction are longer for both valid and invalid words, about 3.7 and 7.0 respectively. More notably for valid words where the average is almost a letter longer than for the one letter predictions.\n",

    "With some of the invalid words for the two letter prediction it is fairly easy to see which words were combined to create the word. For example, \"Offich\" combines \"Office\" and \"which\". \"Houslave\" started with \"House\" and ended with \"slave\". There are also instances where one word had been started but smaller word is a subset of that word and cuts the word short. For example, \"Legis\" is the beginning of \"Legislature\", but \"is\" is a common, short word, so a space is more likely to follow \"is\" than an \"l\"."

A particularly interesting takeaway is that the words and sentences tend to diverge when faced with a common character or word. For instance, a comma, or small words like \"is\" and \"or\", have many possible words that can follow them. So, it is unlikely that the one that makes the most sense will be selected, resulting in the sentence trailing off on a tangent mid-sentence."
